# Self Evaluation

#### How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
- I feel very confident in my understanding of `for` statements.
#### This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- Yes, this was a productive struggle because it pushed me to utilize and recall topics I had previously learned in order to complete the challenges.
#### What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I don't need to learn anything new at this time. But I can see how this topic is very difficult for someone who has never seen it before. If this were my first time working with `for` loops, I'm sure I'd be spending a lot of my time between Mod 0 and Mod 1 getting up-to-speed.
#### What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I do not have any additional questions at this time.
